❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

📌 Project Overview
Cardiovascular diseases are among the leading causes of death globally. Early prediction of heart disease can significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs.
In this project, I developed a supervised machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on clinical and physiological patient data. The model analyzes key medical attributes and classifies whether a patient is at risk.

This project demonstrates:

End-to-end ML pipeline implementation
Data preprocessing & feature analysis
Model training and evaluation
Performance optimization

🎯 Business Problem

Hospitals and healthcare institutions often rely on manual assessment and multiple diagnostic tests to identify heart disease risk.

This project aims to:
Build a predictive model to assist in early risk detection
Support data-driven medical decision-making
Reduce diagnostic time and improve preventive care strategies

📂 Dataset

The dataset used in this project:

Patient demographic and clinical features
Attributes include:
Age
